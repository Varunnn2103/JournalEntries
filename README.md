# 📔 Journal Entries Management System

## 🚀 Overview
The **Journal Entries Management System** is a backend service designed to provide a secure and robust platform for users to create, view, update, and manage their personal or professional journal entries. This application is built with a focus on **security**, **data integrity**, and **scalability**, making it an ideal foundational piece for any logging or simple Content Management System (CMS) application.

## ✨ Features
